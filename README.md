# CZETool
CZEtool is a Python-based tool that includes a `Windows Error Generator`, a `Windows 10/11 Notification Generator`, and an all-in-one batch file for convenience. The tool is designed to streamline common Windows Crazy Error related tasks and make your life easier.

## Usage
To use CZEtool, you will need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system. Run requirement.bat or

```
pip install tkinter
pip install win10toast
```

And then, simply run `czetool.bat`, and you're good to go.

## !!Note!!
While the tool is currently built with `tkinter`, there are plans to migrate to `PySimpleGUI` in the future for more customizable UI options. If you have any ideas or suggestions for new features, don't hesitate to get in touch!
